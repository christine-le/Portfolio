My passion is creating things.  I enjoy challenging myself to continually learn and grow.  That's why I love about software.  There is always a way to improve your craft.  There is always something new to learn.  

I received a Masters in Computer Science in 2007 and have been working in the tech field for almost 15 years.  Over time, I also developed passion for entrepreneurship.  To me, software development and entrepreneurship has been a great way to combine my love for creating things to solve specific problems and have ownership in all I do.  I co-founded a travel startup in 2013, called [Plango](https://www.plango.us) with a former colleague.  Before that, I worked at Apple for several years before deciding to take a leap to work on Plango.

Aside from entrepreneurship, I also enjoy mentoring and teaching others.  In my earlier years, I was fortunate to be a consumer of knowledge and wisdom from very bright colleagues, professors, etc.  Now, I am happy to be in their shoes and help develop others.  I currently get to do this as a part-time mentor at a development bootcamp, [Bloc](http://www.bloc.io), where I get to mentor those learning to program and start a career in the tech field.  This has been a very fun journey for me and in many ways, have sharpened my own skills as I teach.

In this site, I hope to continue sharing knowledge with others.  This site will help me document my learnings, fun projects I work on, productivity hacks, and pretty much all things technical!
