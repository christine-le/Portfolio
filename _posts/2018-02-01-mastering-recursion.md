Recursion is hard.  For many of us, at least.  Although I've been out of college for over 10 years now, I remember the horror I initially encountered in trying to write my first recursive algorithm back then as a newbie Computer Science student.  Many years later, I am working to truly tackle them as part of my larger goal of brushing up on algorithms and data structures.  Sigh... it's hard.

The good news is: as I slowly work through even seemingly simple problems, my muscle memory is improving.  And I find myself really enjoying the mental challenge.  After 3 or 4 programming challenges, I am already feeling much relief from the brain fog compared to when I started with the first exercise earlier this week.

As I work through more of these exercises, I realized how many times I wanted to quit and move onto another challenge.  But I resisted the temptation and made several attempts until I solved them.  I also realized that most of the time, I was over-complicating the solution.  I suspect many people do the same thing when attempting to solve a problem recursively.  

Recall that recursion involves a recursive case (which calls itself) and a base case (which stops the recursive calls).  Recursion requires a bit of blind faith that the _recursive_ function will do what it's supposed to do, all the way to the base case.  It can be hard to trust that the recursive case is doing what it's supposed to do, since we more more naturally tend to think iteratively.  

### Simple Recursion exercises

To dive in, I looked to trusty old Google to find recursion exercises to solve.  Here are a couple simple ones that I found and am working through.  I started off with very simple exercises (e.g., checking for palindromes, finding min element in an array, etc).

Next steps for me are to work on more challenging exercises (e.g., BFS on a binary tree).  If you are curious, check out my solutions on my Github repo [here](https://github.com/christine-le/algorithms/blob/master/recursion.py).  

### Conclusion
Recursion is hard.  BUT it can be mastered or at least be made less scary.  I am looking forward to tackling more problems throughout the next couple of weeks.  I have no doubt it will continue to get easier and easier.  As for now, I will continue chipping away at it because there is no other around these challenging algorithms than to practice.
