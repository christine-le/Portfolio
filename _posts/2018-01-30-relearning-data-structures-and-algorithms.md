I am now in [part 2](http://christinele.io/programming/learning-python/#2-data-structures-and-algorithms) of my goals this year to challenge my programming skills:  re-learning data structures and algorithms.  The hardest part so far is staying *disciplined* to spend at least a couple hours a day working through problems.  It's easy to read or watch videos on concepts, but *physically* working through programming exercises takes a lot of persistence.

It has been over 10 years since I first learned these concepts.  It's easy to get lazy and brush these concepts aside.  But my goal is to learn these concepts deeply and prevent coding atrophy.  One of the things I'm amazed by is the wealth of resources available these days to anyone who wants to learn.  Below are the main resources I am currently using.

### Coding Resources

 - Leetcode.com
 - Hackerrank.com
 - Cracking the Coding Interview book by Gayle Laakmann McDowell
 - A Github account
 
The first two sites are great for small exercises where solutions can be compared to others.  I've mostly been working through the "easy" and "medium" challenges to warm up and get into thinking conceptually.  The discussion tab is useful for understanding how one's own code can be refactored for reducing time or space complexity.  Aside from the many online resources available, the well known book, Cracking the Coding Interview, is a great resource for data structures and algorithms related exercises.  I created two Git repositories ([Data Structures](https://github.com/christine-le/data-structures) and [Algorithms](https://github.com/christine-le/algorithms)) where I check in my exercises from the book or other miscellaneous sites.

### Schedule Breakdown

As already mentioned, consistency and discipline are crucial.  To keep myself accountable, I am using Trello to create and scheduled tasks for the following items.  Although I track my progress weekly, I will occasionally update my daily tasks when I feel the need to spend more time on a particular concept. 

 - Linked Lists
 - Queues
 - Stacks
 - Hash Maps
 - Trees
 - Graphs
 - Searching Algorithms
 - Sorting Algorithms
 - Recursion
 - Time and Space Complexity

### Conclusion
It's only been about 3 weeks since I've started learning Python.  And only about a week and a half since I began working through data structures and algorithms challenges.  I imagine I will dedicate at least another month working through related exercises.  However, my proficiency in Python has already improved a great deal.  So far, I am enjoying the change to Python quite a bit and am especially enjoying the challenge to myself to push through these exercises!
