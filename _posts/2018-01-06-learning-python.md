With the kick off of the new year, I decided to finally get around to learning Python (and starting this blog!).  This has been on my list of things to learn; needly to say, I am excited to pick up this highly, in-demand skill.  I hope to use this current blog post and upcoming ones to document my learning and hopefully share useful tips with others.  And most importantly, keep myself accountable!

Since I already have experience programming in other languages, I find Python fairly easy to program in.  I will document in an upcoming post the nuances of Python that stood out for me.  This will include some of the quirks I noticed, especially as I've most recently been programming in Javascript and Ruby.  Even for those who have experience in programming already, time and discipline is crucial, especially if the goal is to _deeply_ learn a language.

For most of us, a plan of action can help set us up for greater success.  Understanding my strengths, weaknesses, and learning style was important to coming up with a plan.  For me, I know I can easily lean on _"breadth"_ over _"depth."_  After all, it's fun to learn about the latest tools, frameworks, platforms, etc!  Even as I write this, my many project ideas are brewing in the back of my mind (creating a new skill with the Alexa Skills Kit, coding a Raspberry Pi project, etc.).  Fortunately, over the years, I have become much better disciplined at coming up with a game plan for the projects or goals that I want to tackle.   

That said, I came up with a practical plan for myself to learn Python and kill two birds at one time.  The other "bird" I hope to kill is to brush up on Computer Science fundamentals; namely, data structures and algorithms. Being out of college for many years now, I realize the need to brush up on these important fundamentals.  I hope to re-learn these concepts using Python to code practice problems.  To help me manage my productivity and efforts, I created a Trello board of tasks.  (I'm a huge fan of Trello).  As I progress throughout my Python journey, I will post a blog to document my learnings.  Therefore, the breakdown of my plan is as follows:

### 1. Learn the Python fundamentals

To do so, I am using Code Academy's course called "[Learn Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python)."  Code Academy has great free resources online.  I found this course to be fairly straightforward and was able to complete it recently in less than a week, spending anywhere between 1 to 3 hours a day.  For programming newbies, I would recommend taking more time to truly understand some of the more advanced concepts (e.g., bitwise operators, lambda expressions, and classes).

### 2. Data Structures and Algorithms

This is where I currently am in my plan.  As I mentioned, I am challenging myself to re-learn these Computer Science fundamentals again.  No short-cuts here.  This step will contain LOTS of sub-tasks that I will break down further later.  Needless to say, Trello will really come in handy here.  I will spend quite a bit of time and effort here.  Essentially, I will use Python to code data structures including queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, and hashes.  I will also code searching and sorting algorithms.  Additionally, I will make sure not to forget about time and space complexity and that I am well versed in being able to evaluate the complexity of algorithms.  For Christmas, I was gifted the book, "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.  This is an _excellent_ resource chock full of programming problems that addresses data structures and algorithms concepts.

### 3. Projects

Lastly, to continue in the ever so important "learn by doing" paradigm, I will work on one or more projects to further solidify my Python proficiency.  One idea may be to work on a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) competition.  I am a data geek; since most of my tech career has been heavily data-centric.  So this would be right up my ally.  [Devpost](https://devpost.com/hackathons) also has a great list of hackathons to compete in programming challenges.  Yet another idea is to code on the Alexa platform as I mentioned above.  I will think more about the projects after my data structures and algorithms work.

### Happy Hacking

I'm excited to tackle some fun challenges this year with Python.  Much of my efforts in 2017 was spent teaching / mentoring other software developers part time at a development bootcamp and managing everyday aspects of my travel start-up, [Plango](http://www.plango.us), as the CTO. I am looking forward to building things again and preventing entropy in my programming skills.  If you are a bit newer to programming, the above game plan will still be helpful for you.  However, I suggest not focusing on data structures and algorithms as it is its own beast and deserves ample time and effort.  I would recommend working on projects first and circling back on data structures and algorithms in the future.  Cheers to programming in 2018!
